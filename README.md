# Benchmark PHP  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kudashevs/benchmark-php.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kudashevs/benchmark-php)

This is an open-source benchmark application with a set of easy appendable benchmarks for PHP benchmarking.

## Description
Sometimes, we want to test or benchmark a shared hosting, VPS/VDS or dedicated server. This may be a desire to get
some real idea of shared hosting, compare different hosting companies and their plans, choose something new or more
powerful for the same money, and also check changes in performance after making some improvements (hardware update,
performance system settings, etc).

In such cases, different operation system utilities are used, and each developer prefers to use his own set. Faced with
a similar problem once again, I decided why not try to make this set of tests/benchmarks using PHP language, for which
I regularly do all these measurements.


Any ideas, suggestions, and reviews will be much appreciated :)
